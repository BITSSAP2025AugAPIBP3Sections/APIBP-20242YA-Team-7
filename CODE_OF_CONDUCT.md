# Dev Impact Community Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The **Dev Impact** project exists to help developers understand and quantify their contributions. We are committed to fostering a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment where everyone can contribute regardless of their background or experience level.

We believe that building great software requires:
- Technical excellence with human kindness
- Welcoming questions at all levels
- Treating mistakes as learning opportunities
- Valuing different perspectives
- Celebrating collective achievement

---

## Community Values

### Collaboration Over Competition

We celebrate collective achievement. When someone succeeds, the entire Dev Impact community benefits. Share knowledge generously, offer help freely, and recognize that we all started somewhere.

### Curiosity and Learning

Questions at any level are valuable. We encourage experimentation, exploration, and the courage to try new approaches. "I don't know" is the starting point of discovery, not a weakness.

### Technical Quality with Empathy

We hold high standards for code quality and architecture, but we deliver feedback with kindness. Technical discussions should illuminate paths forward, not tear people down.

### Inclusive by Design

We actively work to make Dev Impact accessible and welcoming to developers from all backgrounds, geographies, and experience levels. Diversity makes us stronger and more creative.
